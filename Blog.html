                <p>Chocolate can be very deadly to dogs due to containing the ingredient, theobromine. Dogs cannot
                    metabolize theobromine and ingesting chocolate could cause a severely toxic buildup in their system
                    which could become fatal.</p>

                <p>All puppies are born deaf. As they get older, they can hear 4 times better than humans can.</p>
                <img src="./Img/IMG_4245.JPG" alt="" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
                <p> When your dog is carefully choosing the perfect place to do his business, it is because they prefer
                    to go poop in alignment with the Earth’s magnetic field.</p>

                <p> Dogs can be trained to to detect cancer and other diseases in humans. Cancerous cells release
                    different metabolic waste products than healthy cells in the human body. Dogs may even be able to
                    sniff out cancer cells simply through smelling someone’s breath.</p>

                <p>Your dog is as smart as a two-year old! Ever wonder why children around this age seem to have a
                    special bond with the family dog? It could be because they speak the same language, roughly 250
                    words and gestures in fact.</p>

                <p> claims that your dog can genuinely get jealous when they see you display affection for another
                    creature.</p>

                <p>Petting a dog can actually benefit your physical and mental health. Studies have shown that petting a
                    dog for 15 minutes can lower blood pressure by 10%, can help lower feelings of stress, depression,
                    and combat loneliness.</p>
